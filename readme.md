# Scheepsvaart museum assignment.

The client for this project wanted a website that would allow users to type in their travel information when coming to the museum. Which would then offer an alternative with lower emissions.

I came up with the concept of making use of a lots of animations to try and visualize emissions and make it a lot less abstract. I then worked alone on creating the assets and all the logic of the animatated page. My team did the rest of the website and the logic for getting the data.
